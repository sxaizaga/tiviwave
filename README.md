**Title: TiviWave - Visualize Your Music**

Transform your music into a hypnotic visual experience with TiviWave, the ultimate audio visualizer for macOS.

TiviWave blends the retro aesthetics of classic CRT oscilloscopes with modern audio processing technology to create fluid, real-time reactive visualizations. Whether you are listening to music, producing audio, or just want a stunning visual background, TiviWave brings your sound to life.

**Key Features:**

*   **Vintage Oscilloscope Style**: Enjoy a faithful simulation of analog oscilloscopes with phosphor effects, grids, and CRT scanlines.
*   **Multiple Visual Modes**:
    *   **Classic Oscilloscope**: Pure waveform visualization.
    *   **Vectorscope (XY)**: Visualize stereo phase and amplitude on a 2D plane, perfect for audio analysis and abstract art ("Mushroom patterns").
    *   **Shape Casting**: Geometric shapes that react dynamically to the bass and treble of your music.
    *   **Multi-Wave**: Multiple overlapping waves for a depth effect.
*   **Advanced Controls**: Adjust line thickness, glow, sensitivity, colors, and more to customize your experience.
*   **Flexible Audio Input**: Visualize captured system audio (requires setup) or use the microphone to visualize ambient sound.
*   **Modern Interface**: Native macOS design with light/dark mode support, fully localized in English and Spanish.

**Important Note on System Audio:**
To capture internal Mac audio (Spotify, YouTube, etc.), TiviWave works best with a virtual audio driver like BlackHole (instructions included in the app). Without extra setup, the app can visualize audio via the microphone.
